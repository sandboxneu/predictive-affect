# Predictive Affect Study

This project is a psychology experiment for researcher Danlei Chen of Northeastern University's [Interdisciplinary Affective Science Lab](https://www.affective-science.org/). 
It measures the effect a person's feeling about an image has on their memory of that image.

### No demo is available due to the sensitive nature of the images shown.

## Running the Experiment

`yarn` will install the all the dependencies, and copy `param.example.js` to `param.js` if `param.js` doesn't exist
- `param.js` is the config file, which is gitignored to allow for customization

`yarn build` will build the site. You need to run this after you make changes so they actually get built

`yarn start` will start a server that hosts the app on http://localhost:8080

`yarn test` will run tests with Mocha

As a prerequisite, you will need the images associated with the trials.

## Contributing
We welcome all potential contributors!
If you would like to open a PR to edit code style or resolve an issue, please go ahead.
Please email drew.r@husky.neu.edu if you would like to contribute further to this project, as you will need the images, which are sensitive and will require a conversation before access is granted.
