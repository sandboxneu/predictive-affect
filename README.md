# Predictive Affect Study

This project is a psychology experiment for researcher Danlei Chen of Northeastern University's [Interdisciplinary Affective Science Lab](https://www.affective-science.org/). 
It measures the effect a person's feeling about an image has on their memory of that image.

## Running the Experiment

Due to the nature of the experiment and specifics of the task, the experiment is 100% static and can be run by simply opening up index.html. 
As a prerequisite, you will need the images associated with the trials.

## Contributing
We welcome all potential contributors!
If you would like to open a PR to edit code style or resolve an issue, please go ahead.
Please email drew.r@husky.neu.edu if you would like to contribute further to this project, as you will need the images, which are sensitive and will require a conversation before access is granted.


_Predictive Affect is a [Sandbox](https://sandboxneu.com) project._
